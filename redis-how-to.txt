01) I went here: "http://redis.io/" and downloaded "redis-3.2.8.tar.gz" (or do next step).

02) I went here for some basic instructions: "http://redis.io/download", which were:
        wget -c http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-3.2.8.tar.gz
        tar xzf redis-3.2.8.tar.gz
        cd redis-3.2.8
        make
        
03) Now the Redis server is built, and we can start it:
        src/redis-server &

04) Now Redis is ready.
